# CNN-python
 The implementation of a Convolutional neural network based on Python-NumPy.
### Layers
- [X] Fully connected layer (forward & backward)
- [X] Convolutional layer (forward & backward)
- [X] Pooling layer (forward & backward)
- [X] Zero Padding layer (forward & backward)
- [X] Dropout (forward & backward)
- [] BatchNorm (forward & backward)

### Activate functions
- [X] ReLU  (forward & backward)
- [X] Softmax (forward & backward)
- [X] Sigmoid (forward & backward)
### Loss functions
- [X] Cross Entropy Loss 

### Data set
THE [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) DATABASE of handwritten digits.

### Training 
- training the CNN.
